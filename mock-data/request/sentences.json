{"content":"This land is your land. This land is my land\\nFrom California to the New York island;\\nFrom the wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters\\n\\nThis land was made for you and Me.\\n\\nAs I was walking that ribbon of highway,\\nI saw above me that endless skyway:\\nI saw below me that golden valley:\\nThis land was made for you and me."}
